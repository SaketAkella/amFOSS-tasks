Hello guys! I'm Akella Saket from Vizag, a district in Andhra Pradesh. This blog is dedicated to the processes or struggles I faced during the installation of ubuntu on my windows laptop. So the first thing I did when i heard about installing ubutu was to google the process which i clearly did not understand which made me realise the importance of youtube(laugh emoji). Intitially i thought installing the operating system virtually through Vmware would suffice and thought would count as ompleting the task which wasnt the case, silly me.
The next thing i did was to read the process to dual boot a laptop which was looked pretty simple in the beginning but beleive me the struggle is real. The first thing to be done is to create a driver partition in our devices. So here are some of the prerequisites that are requiured:
1. a minimum of 50gb partitioned driver(I did 100gb). THis counts as the free space for the OS to run
2. Latest version of ubuntu installed on your device(i did the 22.04 version which was a stable version during the my time of intallation)
3. Have a virtual usbware installed on your laptop
              or
3. A physical pendrive with ubuntu downloaded in it.

The issue I faced while installing ubuntu was the intallation through physical pendriver was going on fine but the location of the linux OS was my main driver (which i had backed up), it wasnt going in to the New Partitioned driver hence had to format that main driver and repeat the process multiple times, though it was a bit tiring and draining out my patience, it was fun as i was fiddling with a lot of new settings i hadnt touched before. At last it worked and the operating system was placed in its desired location.
So guys, this was my experience with dual booting my laptop i wouldnt say it was a dead easy task, i ve had my fair share of issues and problems but this was surely worth the experience as i got to learn a lot of new things.
