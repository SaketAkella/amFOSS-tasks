## My views about the tasks
I would say the tasks are pretty basic if you know basics of the repective language or the field, but again I have not attempted and completed all the 15 tasks so i feel the tasks were of medium difficulty level. One thing I would coin is that the amount of exposure and knowledge I gained in this phase of solving tasks was impeccable and I will try to continue the same despite the completion of tasks, I feel leraning new things has been the "new normal" for me. These tasks have played a significant role in developing my self-learning skills.
