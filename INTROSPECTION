INTROSPECTION:
Why must we choose you?
I've been a coding enthusiasist since my childhood, though i havent significantly worked towards it. I feel am-Foss would be a fuel
for me to work hard and step in to the world of coding. I feel my passion towards this field will continuously keep me engaged  in learning 
new stuff and exploring the unknowns benefitting the club. I've been a procastinator since the lockdown period but I feel this passion
inside will help me break bounds and work hard as I see Am-foss guiding me through it.

What is your plan for the next 6 months?
I find competative progamming pretty intersting and after I got to know about its perks and value it holds, the  thought of pursuing
it has become even more stronger. I feel Am-foss will be a great platform as it has a lot of skilled mentors and a great reputation hence 
I see myelf working towards it.

How would you contribute back to the club?
I promise to find myslef in a state where i would work the limits of providing acheivements that the club would be proud of. I would surely
help in mentoring my fellow mates as well as the upcoming juniors when I'm capable of doing so.

Do you have any feedback for the selection process?
I feel the selection process has been very proffessional and the mentee-mentor relationship has been purely exceptional as their help has
guided me through this phase. I feel this phase has helped me mature a little bit, has given me a little insight on what it really means to
learn and grasp a language and implementing it to acheive something.
